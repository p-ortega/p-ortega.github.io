As you may not know, my PhD focused on the reactive transport and geochemistry of in-situ recovery of copper, also known as Cu-ISR. I find Cu-ISR and ISR in general quite fascinating. One of the biggest challenges of this technology, especially for Cu and other metals, is the lack of predictive reactive transport models that can accurately forecast recovery and financial success while ensuring minimal environmental disturbance. However, that\u0026rsquo;s a story for another post. In this intro post, I will introduce conventional Cu-ISR. We will explore later why I refer to hydraulic-driven Cu-ISR as \u0026ldquo;conventional,\u0026rdquo; but for now, let\u0026rsquo;s delve into the key concepts and see if I can convince you that Cu-ISR has great potential for future applications. Please note that most of this text is copied from my PhD thesis, so there may be some self-copyright infringement, but hey, free information is free information, right?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started!\nWhat is Cu-ISR? ISR, also known as in-situ leaching (ISL) or solution mining, is a mining method that involves injecting a solution into the ground to dissolve specifically targeted minerals or metals. The solution, which is called a lixiviant, is typically an acid or a mixture between an acid and an oxidant1, although alkaline solutions have also been tested. The lixiviant is injected through a well into the ore deposit. As the solution migrates across the ore deposit, it dissolves the targeted minerals or metals, which are then transported to an extraction well. Therefore, ISR has the potential to significantly reduce landscape scarring, eliminate tailings dams and waste rock stockpiles, and minimise energy consumption and carbon emissions.\nWhy isn\u0026rsquo;t Cu-ISR more commonly used? Despite its promise, Cu-ISR has primarily been applied to shallow ore bodies, predominantly uranium deposits, where the grades are relatively uniformly distributed. It appears to be less suitable for deposits with complex geometries or those located at great depths. One of the main limitations of Cu-ISR is the challenge of inducing rapid solution migration through ore bodies with very low hydraulic conductivity. As a result, while Cu-ISR has been successfully employed for uranium extraction2,3, it has not yet been widely adopted for other types of metal deposits. Another significant limitation of ISR is the potential contamination of groundwater and surrounding ecosystems if highly reactive chemicals injected into the subsurface are not properly managed. Therefore, to expand the application beyond uranium mining, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of its techno-economic feasibility for suitable copper deposits. This requires assessing the geological, hydrogeological, and mineralogical conditions under which Cu-ISR can be effectively and safely utilized. Enhanced understanding of these factors will not only address technical and economic issues but also contribute to increased public acceptance of Cu-ISR, wherever it proves to be a suitable method and maintains a social license to operate.\nCu-ISR Applications: Past and Present Over the past decades, in-situ recovery has been extensively applied to uranium mining. In 2020, around 57 % of global uranium production was supplied by ISR4. The success of uranium in-situ recovery (U-ISR) can be largely attributed to the specific characteristics of typically mined uranium deposits. These are generally sedimentary deposits that possess sufficient hydraulic conductivity to permit the lixiviant to migrate sufficiently fast across them. Additionally, they are often hydraulically constrained, such that the migration of the lixiviant is easier to be controlled and directed towards the recovery well. U-ISR is the main mining method for uranium in Kazakhstan, Australia, China, Russia, Uzbekistan, and the United States. For example, Beverley and Beverley North (South Australia) are closed mines currently under care and maintenance status, and Four Mile is a current ISR mine in Australia. Those deposits are characterised by sand and gravel sediments, where the mineralization occurs at depths between 100 and 250 m5. U-ISR is becoming increasingly popular in other countries like Canada. For example, Denison Mines is currently developing the Phoenix deposit and conducting ISR testing with recovery rates of up to 97 %6.\nFor copper and other metals, however, ISR applications are sparse, and the outcomes in terms of recovery efficiency are far more diverse. Currently, no copper mines are using ISR in a full-scale operational mode. However, various test facilities have been set up, and several field trials have been undertaken with variable success. Examples of completed field trials include Casa Grande and Safford in Arizona (copper porphyry), Gunpowder in South Australia (copper oxides), and Chuquicamata in Chile (paleochannel). Examples of ceased mine operations include Mount ISA in Queensland (copper oxides) and San Manuel in Arizona (copper porphyry)2. Among all previous endeavours, the ISR operation at the San Manuel mine has been the most successful, reaching a production of 11,000 ton/yr at its peak7. In general, the crucial showstoppers for many of these projects have been (i) the lack of sufficient permeability and (ii) the loss of lixiviant through fractured zones of the targeted deposits. Currently, new tests are being undertaken in Florence (Arizona) and Kapunda (South Australia). Both projects target oxidised copper ore and have conducted advanced hydrometallurgical testing. Florence Copper has received environmental approval to inject lixiviants and is currently the most advanced copper ISR project. Overall, the majority of attempts to develop Cu-ISR projects have been undertaken for copper oxide deposits2. Even in San Manuel, the successfully exploited part of the porphyry corresponded to the oxidised shallower cap. However, to make ISR a more widely applicable and efficient mining technology, extending its use to copper sulphides is crucial. This is because most of the world\u0026rsquo;s copper reserves are found to be hosted by chalcopyrite, which is often found in the sulphidic zones of copper porphyries.\nIn the next series of blog posts, I\u0026rsquo;ll be talking about how reactive transport and numerical modelling can help make Cu-ISR a reality while assuring its environmental safety.\nBarton, I.

Reactive transport models, or RTMs, combine fluid dynamics, chemical equilibrium and kinetics principles, and geology to model the movement and transformation of solutes in complex geological systems. As mentioned in the previous post, ISR mainly operates in complex geological settings. Many past endeavours had failed to be economically feasible, with little information about why they failed. I think the failure comes from the complexity of ore, which is usually overlooked.\nThere are two main aspects where RTM can be beneficial for ISR. The first is to help understand complex laboratory experiments, and the second is to forecast copper recovery at an operational scale while estimating the inherent uncertainty of the results. Traditionally in metallurgy (especially hydrometallurgy), laboratory experiments have been the backbone for understanding copper extraction efficiency. However, these experiments often provide limited insight into the complex dynamics of in situ recovery.\nThe implications of RTMs extend far beyond the laboratory. By accurately predicting the behaviour of copper dissolution and transport in the subsurface, these models offer a powerful tool for forecasting the performance of ISR on a larger scale. From assessing the economic viability of potential mining sites to optimizing extraction methods, the ability to make data-driven decisions based on reliable simulations has the potential to revolutionize the mining industry.\nIn this RTM Part 1, I\u0026rsquo;ll be focusing on how RTM can help extract more information from (hydro)metallurgical experiments for ISR, which was the focus of my PhD and first research paper1. In the next series, we will go together on how to build an RTM for experimental and large-scale predictive purposes using open-source codes, Python and PEST.\nWhat are the limitations of ISR experiments? One of the crucial aspects of ISR is the coupled nature of solute transport and in-situ geochemical processes. The traditional set of experimental tests for ISR, however, usually remove one or the other. For example, bottlerolls experiments remove the transport part of the dynamic to focus only in the dissolution chemistry. Columns experiments, in the other hand, are a good, but not perfect, options to include coupled processes. Most of the time results from column experiments can mask underlying geochemical processes that can be important at larger time and spatial scales.\nCu-ISR column experiments Here I\u0026rsquo;m going to describe the experiments we did for this study. We did three column experiments with material obtained from a prospective site in South Australia (Kapunda). We used ferric sulphate and sulphuric acid to leach the samples and, interestingly, natural groundwater to make up the solutions. We programmed the experiments to have multi-stage leaching starting with water only (from the site) and progressing to acidic leaching and eventually to oxidative leaching, testing progressively higher concentrations of the oxidation. The acid concentration was kept the same during all the stages. We collected solution samples during all the experiments but characterised the material (QXRD and QEMSCAN) only before starting the tests. If you are not familiar with column experiments, they look like the following:\nReactive transport models of the columns We used PHT3D, which couples MODFLOW-2005, MT3DMS and PHREEQC to model the columns. The columns were represented as a one-dimensional domain divided into small grid cells. The models simulated the leaching process over the experiment\u0026rsquo;s total duration, with the initial conditions based on the measured and estimated mineral concentrations. We used the WATEQ4F database for the reaction network. After some initial tests, we realised that some preferential flow paths existed in the columns, so we decided to go for a dual-domain mass transfer approach to simulate this behaviour.\nWe simulated all the mineral dissolution as kinetic, which is a good approach to this kind of experiment. If you are a geochemist and want to know which minerals we simulated, here they are:\nMineral Dissolution Rate Reference Chalcopyrite Kimball (2010) Chalcocite Hashemzadeh (2019) Chalcanthite Depending on thermodynamic drive Malachite Nicol (2018) Pyrite Rimstidt (1993) Main results The following images and texts show the main results arising from the fit of the models to the experimental data.\nThe presence of flow paths in the columns influenced Cu breakthrough behaviour. The dual-domain mass transfer (DDMT) approach, accounting for mass transfer between mobile and immobile domains, provided a better match with experimental observations than single-domain models, especially regarding tailing shapes in the curves (see green vs pink fits). The model simulations helped understand the contribution of different Cu minerals to overall Cu recovery in each leaching stage. The fraction of Cu recovery attributed to specific minerals varied between stages. Dissolution of Cu oxides dominated in the early stages, and Cu sulphides became more significant in later stages with higher oxidant concentrations. The following image shows the simulated recovery percentages from each mineral for each stage. Finally, we also simulated gangue mineral reactions, from where we suggested the following:\nThe samples had a lot of pyrite, and pyrite usually has a lot of impurities. We improved the fit of cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni), including a fraction of those into the pyrite structure.\nWe also speculated about jarosite precipitation during the experiments and how it helped us fit K. If higher enough amounts of jarosite precipitate in the field (common in Acid Mine Drainage) would generate an operational issue.\nI hope you\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed learning a bit about Cu-ISR, experiments and reactive transport modelling. If you want to get deeper into these experiments and models, please go ahead and read my paper. In the next post, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to go step-by-step on how to build a model of this kind using open-source code.\nOrtega-Tong, P., Jamieson, J., Kuhar, L., Faulkner, L., Prommer, H. 2023.

I\u0026rsquo;m a computational geoscientist with a solid nine years of experience in consulting, specializing in numerical modeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m a huge fan of simulating, predicting, and quantifying how contaminants move around in groundwater. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s tracking PFAS, Cu\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e or hydrocarbons, I love digging into the nitty-gritty of their fate and transport. I\u0026rsquo;m also pretty enthusiastic about modeling in-situ metal recovery, figuring out how we can dissolve and transport metals right where they are underground (decarbonisation is totally hyping this up). I\u0026rsquo;m keen to applied uncertainty analysis and optimization for reactive transport and transport-only problems.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"About me"}]
